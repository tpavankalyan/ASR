# Procedures for handling acts of academic malpractices by
students

Acts of academic malpractices by students are dealt with at two levels. At the department level,
they are handled by a Departmental Academic Disciplinary Action Committee (D-ADAC) and
at the institute level, by the Academic Disciplinary Action Committee (ADAC). The D-ADAC
deals with acts which attract a maximum disciplinary action of a fail grade (FR or DX). Acts
which deserve a more stringent disciplinary action are handled by the ADAC.
An instructor, on discovery of a case of academic malpractice by a student will report it to
the Head of the Academic Unit who will refer it to the D-ADAC. The D-ADAC will examine
each case and recommend an appropriate disciplinary action, which is forwarded, via the Head,
to the Dean (AP) for implementation. The Dean (AP) may approve the recommendation and
forward it to the Academic Office for implementation or may forward it to the ADAC for
consideration. In cases of serious acts of malpractice, like impersonation, repeat offences by
the same student, etc., the D-ADAC forwards the documents through the Head to the Dean
(AP)â€™s office. In such cases, the appropriate disciplinary action is decided by the ADAC. The
Dean (AP) will finally forward the decision of the ADAC to the Director for approval.
Remark. The instructor should send such complaints to the Head of the Department which
administers the course. For instance, if a student of the Electrical Engineering Department is
found cheating in a course run by the Civil Engineering Department being taught by a faculty
member from the Mathematics Department then the report should be submitted to the Head
of the Civil Engineering Department.
